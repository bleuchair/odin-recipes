        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.

        <li>For mushroom sauce, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add mushrooms; cook and stir over medium heat for 1 minute. Add thyme, garlic, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cook until mushrooms are golden, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes more.
            Mix in flour; gradually stir in milk. Cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Continue cooking and stirring for 2 minutes more.</li>
